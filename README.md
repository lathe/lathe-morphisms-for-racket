# Lathe Morphisms for Racket

[![Travis build](https://travis-ci.org/lathe/lathe-morphisms-for-racket.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lathe/lathe-morphisms-for-racket)

Lathe Morphisms for Racket is a library providing interfaces and constructions of abstract algebraic concepts. Programming languages themselves have rich algebraic properties, so algebras can be handy for building DSLs or for discovering convenient minimalistic interfaces.


## Installation and use

This is a library for Racket. To install it, run `raco pkg install --deps search-auto` from the `lathe-morphisms-lib/` directory, and then put an import like `(require lathe-morphisms)` in your Racket program.

The interface to Lathe Morphisms will eventually be documented in the `lathe-morphisms-doc/` package's documentation.
